# CS_340_Project

**Major Citation:**
- **The code in this project is based heavily off the CS 340 Canvas template code.** Many of the routes, forms, and general
    page layouts are based off this code. However, the SQL, CSS, failure notification pages, and helper functions are original, and the forms and design
    elements were _adapted_ from the template code so as to maintain some originality.

 * Reason for use: I used this comment to inspire a method of date manipulation in my program. However, I did not use the code / exact
   method used; rather, all that was used was the idea of using JS functions to extract certain parts of the date (i.e. month, year, day)
   from the overall date.
